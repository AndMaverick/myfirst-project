# Maverick Experiments 🚀

This repository is a sandbox for building and shipping ideas.  
I use it to test concepts, write small utilities, and capture what I’m learning along the way.  

## What You’ll Find Here
- Simple tools and scripts that solve everyday problems ⚡  
- Notes and experiments as I explore new technologies 🔍  
- Foundations for larger projects I’ll grow over time 🌱  

## Current Focus
Building a consistent workflow on GitHub and laying the groundwork for future projects.  

Stay tuned — new drops coming soon.
## 🚀 Scripts

### `word_counter.py`
A simple utility script that counts the number of words in any text file.  

**How it works:**  
- Reads the contents of a text file.  
- Splits the text into words.  
- Outputs the total word count.  

**Usage Example:**  
```bash
python word_counter.py

---

🔑 Why this works:  
- Shows clarity: anyone looking knows exactly what the script does.  
- Adds professional polish: your repo isn’t just “code” — it’s documented.  
- Recruiters/devs love repos with **readable explanations**.  

👉 Do you want me to rewrite your whole README to integrate this cleanly (so it flows naturally with the “Maverick Experiments 🚀” intro you already have), or do you want to paste this in as a separate section for now?
